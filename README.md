# Email/SMS Spam Classifier

This repository contains an Email/SMS Spam Classifier that predicts whether a given text is spam or not. The project employs a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) with hyperparameter tuning to achieve high precision and accuracy.

## üìñ Project Overview

### Objective
The goal of this project is to classify input text as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques. A strong focus has been placed on achieving high **precision**, ensuring the model minimizes false positives for spam detection.

### Key Features
- **Text Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenization
  - Removal of stop words, punctuation, and special characters
  - Stemming
- **Vectorization**: Text is transformed using the **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** method to create numerical feature vectors.
- **Model Selection**:
  - Several classification models were evaluated.
  - The **Random Forest Classifier** demonstrated the best performance in terms of **precision** and **accuracy**.
- **Deployment**: The model is deployed using **Streamlit Cloud**, providing an interactive web interface.
